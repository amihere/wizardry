wizardry
=================
Summon code using wizard sauce.  
This vim plugin gives you code summoning speed.

Why?
----

Why? Why??
You are welcome to type and talk, like a noob.
Or, you can use wizardry, and pretend to type by randomly typing and letters magically appear.

Use these new powers with caution, my'boy.

Installation
------------

Start with [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)/[vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)  
Put `plugin/wizardry.vim` in `~/.vim/plugin/`  

OR, source it for one-time use, like so:

`:source plugin/wizardry.vim`

Using Packer,
```
use { 'amihere/wizardry' }
```

Usage
-----

Open (n)vim, and command your power:
```
:Accio /path/to/some/file
```
While in **insert** mode, pressing any letter summons a new character of the file specified.
Go on, be a wizard.
